Get yourself set up locally:
1. Make sure to have git and VSCode downloaded on your computer before proceeding, and to log into github in your terminal, you will need an SSH key
2. Once you have all of that set up doing a git clone command to get the files locally 
After you have done the above you should be able to see all the files locally, you can do a git fetch and a git pull to make sure that they are up to date
Going forward to complete any updates:
3. Any changes you would like to make can be done at this time, once you are satisfied you can commit and push your code. Within a few minutes the github page will have redeployed and should show any changes you have made
